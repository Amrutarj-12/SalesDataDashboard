## Sales Data Analysis Project

* Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a CSV file and provides insights into total revenue, top-performing products, and sales distribution across regions.
It uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

##Features

1.Load and clean sales data from CSV.

2.Calculate total revenue.

3.Identify top products by revenue.

4.Analyze sales by region.

5.Visualize insights with bar charts and pie charts.

##Dataset Format

The dataset should be in CSV format, for example:

Product,Quantity,Price,Region
Laptop,5,60000,North
Mobile,10,15000,South
Headphones,15,2000,East
Laptop,3,60000,West


1.Product â†’ Name of the product

2.Quantity â†’ Units sold
